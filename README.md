###### BIRIYANI


I love Biryani, the famous layered, **fragrant rice and meat dish** that takes hours and hours to prepare. It is one of **my favourite thing that my mother cook the best**. Every Indian household has their own complex way of preparing it, and their individual secret ingredients. According to my family lore, it is the water of a particular city that gives each Biryani its distinct flavor. Youâ€™ll find different versions in various parts of India--and at restaurants in the US as well.
